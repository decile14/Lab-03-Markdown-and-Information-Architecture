## Famous Poems

1. “No Man Is An Island” by John Donne
	*No man is an island,
	Entire of itself,
	Every man is a piece of the continent,
	A part of the main.
	If a clod be washed away by the sea,
	Europe is the less.
	As well as if a promontory were.
	As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
	Or of thine own were:
	Any man’s death diminishes me,
	Because I am involved in mankind,
	And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
	It tolls for thee.*
	
2. “Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day?" by William Shakespeare
	*Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
	Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
	And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
	And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
	And every fair from fair sometime declines,
	By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
	But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
	Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
	Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
	When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
	So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
	So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.*
	

3.“If You Forget Me” by Pablo Neruda
	*I want you to know
	one thing.
	You know how this is:
	if I look
	at the crystal moon, at the red branch
	of the slow autumn at my window,
	if I touch
	near the fire
	the impalpable ash
	or the wrinkled body of the log,
	everything carries me to you,
	as if everything that exists,
	aromas, light, metals,
	were little boats
	that sail
	toward those isles of yours that wait for me.
	Well, now,
	if little by little you stop loving me
	I shall stop loving you little by little.
	If suddenly
	you forget me
	do not look for me,
	for I shall already have forgotten you.
	If you think it long and mad,
	the wind of banners
	that passes through my life,
	and you decide
	to leave me at the shore
	of the heart where I have roots,
	remember
	that on that day,
	at that hour,
	I shall lift my arms
	and my roots will set off
	to seek another land.
	But
	if each day,
	each hour,
	you feel that you are destined for me
	with implacable sweetness,
	if each day a flower
	climbs up to your lips to seek me,
	ah my love, ah my own,
	in me all that fire is repeated,
	in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
	my love feeds on your love, beloved,
	and as long as you live it will be in your arms
	without leaving mine.*


# Fiction 
## Definition

Fiction writing is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a short story, novel, novella, screenplay, or drama, which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of authors practice fictional writing, including novelists, playwrights, short story writers, radio dramatists and screenwriters. The first recorded knowledge of ficiton writing occured in the 1170's. 

## Famous Authors

	Herman Melville (born Melvill; August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. Among his best-known works are Typee (1846), a romantic account of his experiences of Polynesian life, and his masterpiece Moby-Dick (1851). Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a merchant. Typee, his first book, was followed by a sequel, Omoo (1847). Both were successful and gave him the financial basis to marry Elizabeth Shaw, a daughter of a prominent Boston family. His first novel not based on his own experiences, Mardi (1849), was not well received. His next fictional work, Redburn (1849), and his non-fiction White-Jacket (1850) were given better reviews but did not provide financial security.

## Famous Books

1. *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley

2. *The Picture of Dorian Gray* by Oscar Wilde

Fearing the story was indecent, the magazine's editor deleted roughly five hundred words before publication without Wilde's knowledge. Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.

# Songs 
## Definition

A songwriter is a professional that writes lyrics and composes musical compositions for songs. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre and film scoring, but is also associated writing and composing the original musical composition or musical bed. A songwriter that writes the lyrics/words are referred to as lyricist. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. Stephen Collins Foster (July 4, 1826 – January 13, 1864), known as "the father of American music", was an American songwriter known primarily for his parlor and minstrel music. He wrote more than 200 songs.
